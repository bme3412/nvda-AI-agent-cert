Agentic AI represents the next evolution beyond generative AI, moving from simple one-step prompt-and-response interactions to complex multi-step processes where AI systems interact with different platforms to achieve desired outcomes. Unlike traditional generative AI where you prompt a model and receive an answer, agentic AI engages in sophisticated workflows—for example, an AI-powered help desk could autonomously understand IT support tickets, reset passwords, install software updates, and escalate issues to human staff when necessary. Gartner predicts that by 2028, at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI, up from essentially 0% in 2024. While these systems promise improved efficiency, cost savings, and the ability to free up staff for more critical tasks requiring human reasoning, they also introduce several significant challenges that organizations must address to ensure trustworthiness and security.
The first major challenge is model logic and critical thinking. In agentic AI systems, one agent acts as a "planner" that orchestrates multiple other agents, while a separate model provides a "critical thinker" function that offers feedback on the planner's output and the actions of executing agents. The more feedback generated, the better the insights and outputs become. However, for this to work effectively, the critical thinker model needs training on data that's closely grounded in reality, with extensive information on specific goals, plans, actions, and results. This requires many iterations—potentially hundreds or thousands of plan-and-result cycles—before the model has sufficient data to function as an effective critical thinker, making the development process resource-intensive and time-consuming.
Reliability and predictability present the second challenge. Traditional software development is inherently predictable—engineers write code that tells computers exactly what to do, step by step. Agentic AI fundamentally changes this paradigm because you don't tell the agent what to do step by step; instead, you specify the desired outcome and the agent determines how to reach that goal. This autonomy introduces randomness in outputs, similar to what we saw when ChatGPT and other generative AI systems first debuted. However, just as generative AI has seen considerable improvements in consistency over the past two years through fine-tuning, human feedback loops, and continuous training efforts, agentic AI will require similar dedicated effort to minimize randomness and become more predictable and reliable.
Data privacy and security represent perhaps the most concerning challenge, as these issues are similar to those in generative AI but amplified by agentic AI's broader access and autonomy. When users engage with language models, every piece of information becomes embedded in the model with no way to make it "forget" that data, creating vulnerabilities to attacks like prompt injection that attempt to leak proprietary information. Because software agents have access to many different systems with high levels of autonomy, the risk of exposing private data from multiple sources increases significantly. To address this, companies need to start small and containerize data as much as possible to prevent exposure beyond the internal domain where it's needed. Critical steps include anonymizing data by obscuring users and stripping personally identifiable information like social security numbers or addresses from prompts before sending them to models.
Organizations can categorize agentic AI systems into three types with different security implications. Consumer agentic AI typically involves an internal user interface with an external AI model, where companies have zero control over the AI itself and can only manage the data and prompts they send. Employee agentic AI is built internally for internal usage and, while lower risk, still poses dangers of exposing highly private information to nonqualified users within the company—for instance, when building custom GPT-like experiences for internal use only. Customer-facing agentic AI, built by businesses to serve their customers, carries the highest stakes since it involves external interactions, requiring excellent segmentation to avoid exposing private customer data between different customers.
Data quality and relevancy constitute the fourth challenge. Once data and users have been anonymized, agentic models must deliver results grounded in quality data relevant to user prompts—a significant hurdle. Generative AI models already struggle to deliver expected results when disconnected from accurate, current data, and agentic AI systems face additional complexity because they need to access data across a wide variety of platforms and sources. Data streaming platforms can help by providing tools that enable relevant answers using high-quality data. For example, developers can use Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect to bring in data from disparate sources, and Apache Flink to communicate with other models. Agentic AI systems will only overcome hallucinations and generate correct responses if they're grounded in reliable, fresh data.
The fifth challenge involves ROI and talent acquisition. AI remains new territory for many companies, requiring significant investments in new hardware and GPUs, creation of new data infrastructure with specialized memory management for caching and short-term and long-term storage, and building inference models in-house. These efforts demand hiring new talent with specialized AI skills or training existing workers, and return on investment will take time, especially for early adopters. The upfront costs are substantial, and companies need to be prepared for delayed returns on their investments.
Despite these significant hurdles, agentic AI is expected to spread through enterprises much like generative AI has, with major technology vendors already moving in this direction. Microsoft Copilot, for example, has evolved from simply automating certain code processes to acting agentically to write and test code. Before companies can realize the benefits of agentic AI, they must be prepared to resolve issues of reliability, data privacy and quality, and model logic, while also accepting significant upfront investments. However, for those willing to navigate these challenges, the potential business impact may be much greater than what's currently being achieved with generative AI alone, making the effort and investment worthwhile for organizations seeking competitive advantage in an increasingly AI-driven landscape.
