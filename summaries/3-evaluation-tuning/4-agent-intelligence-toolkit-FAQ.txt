Understanding NVIDIA Agent Intelligence (AIQ) Toolkit
The NVIDIA Agent Intelligence (AIQ) toolkit is a flexible, opt-in system designed to enhance your existing agentic workflows without requiring major code rewrites. You can integrate it at whatever level makes sense for your needs—whether that's wrapping individual tools, entire agents, or complete workflows. While NVIDIA encourages users to decorate every tool and agent to maximize the profiler's benefits, you have complete freedom to start small, focusing on areas where you expect the most value, and then expand your integration from there.
It's important to understand what AIQ toolkit is not. It's not a new LLM or agentic framework attempting to replace what you're already using. It's not trying to solve agent-to-agent communication, which is better handled through established protocols like MCP, HTTP, gRPC, and sockets. And while it can collect and transmit detailed telemetry data, it's not an observability platform meant to replace your existing monitoring and data collection tools
