4. Failing to engage impacted users or change champions

5. Overlooking governance and responsible AI

In recent months, U.S. companies have been exploring agentic AI at a rapid pace, applying it in fields from logistics to IT services. Most enterprises, however, still face major integration hurdles. By focusing on holistic adoption strategies, setting realistic ROI goals, and involving employees early, organizations can confidently build the future of autonomous intelligence in the enterprise.

Pitfall 1: Taking a Technology-Only Approach
It is tempting for a company adopting agentic AI to focus solely on technology and ignore the broader organizational context. However, successful AI transformation requires a holistic approach encompassing strategy, capabilities, ethical standards, and workforce development. A 2024 survey of U.S. tech leaders revealed that 86% of organizations need to upgrade their existing technology stack—and reevaluate their structures and processes—to deploy AI agents effectively. This indicates that treating agentic AI as merely a plug-and-play solution often leads to breakdowns.

To fully harness the potential of AI-human collaboration, organizations must adopt a multi-level strategy. This involves not only technological components but also aligning organizational structures and workforce readiness. Integrating agentic AI impacts the entire organization, necessitating systemic changes and coordinated decision-making. Companies can use organizational readiness assessments to evaluate technical and data preparedness (e.g., data availability and quality), leadership alignment, AI literacy, support systems, and governance frameworks.

Proactively addressing the gaps identified by the readiness assessments helps build a strong foundation for the implementation, ensuring that robust training resources are available, ethical considerations are met, and strategic goals are aligned with AI capabilities. These assessments pinpoint areas that need improvement, facilitating smoother agentic AI adoption and fostering an environment where AI and human potential are maximized. By adopting a deliberate and coordinated strategy to evaluate the optimal maturity level of human-AI decision intelligence, organizations can effectively integrate agentic AI, positioning a workplace for future success, characterized by innovation and collaboration.

Pitfall 2: Not Aligning and Setting Leadership Expectations
Strong leadership and clear communication are paramount in tackling AI mistrust and breaking down silos. Leaders play a critical role in championing AI initiatives and fostering inclusive environments that bolster trust in agentic AI. Effective leaders should focus on transparency, ethical data use, and creating a psychologically safe environment for employees to surface concerns.

Leaders act as change agents in successfully adopting new technologies like agentic AI, guiding their employees through the transition. However, when leaders lack clarity on the expected outcomes of agentic AI, it becomes challenging to align its implementation with the organization’s goals and to unlock its full value. Recent examples show that more than 90% of IT executives surveyed have implemented at least one instance of AI, yet nearly half aren’t sure how to demonstrate the value. Not establishing clear ROI expectations can lead to misaligned adoption efforts.


Often, transformation failure can be traced back to a lack of strong sponsorship and unclear or unrealistic expectations of success. For agentic AI to effectively support an organization’s strategic goals and values, leaders must understand its capabilities, limitations, and potential risks. They need to know how AI makes decisions, the expected outcomes, and how it can be implemented responsibly and ethically.

To mitigate these challenges and move towards responsible autonomy, leaders should define use cases aligned with organizational goals and values. While the allure of agentic AI's autonomous power may seem like a magic wand solution, it is essential to involve a human-in-the-loop approach to provide appropriate oversight, depending on the use case and the organization’s preparedness. It’s important to understand how the AI model will be trained, the monitoring required, and the level of oversight needed.

Once leaders are well-informed, they can make educated decisions on the impact of agentic AI on human-AI roles and integrate into business processes. Not only can they then manage expectations, but they can rally employees to adopt AI responsibly. Upskilling leadership in AI governance is critical; more than half of AI-driven breakdowns in enterprise come from leadership’s unrealistic timelines for ROI. Through strong leadership support, clear communication channels, and celebrations for quick wins and achievements, leaders can build momentum and maintain trust in AI within their organizations.

Pitfall 3: Not Closing AI Literacy Gaps
AI literacy is essential for successful AI adoption. Employees with higher AI literacy are less likely to harbor misconceptions and more likely to accept and trust AI. Conversely, low AI literacy among leaders and employees can significantly hinder AI adoption, limiting its transformative potential within organizations.

When leaders lack an understanding of AI's capabilities, limitations, and the governance needed, they are ill-equipped to champion AI initiatives and set realistic expectations. To avoid unrealistic goal-setting and inefficient implementation, leaders must be upskilled in AI literacy, ideally within the context of specific AI use cases.

This balanced education should encompass both technical knowledge and human-centric topics, such as fostering adoption, setting clear expectations, and ensuring responsible AI governance. By improving their AI literacy, leaders can more effectively guide their teams through the AI adoption process.

Empowering employees with AI literacy is equally important, starting at the foundational level of agentic AI maturity. Companies like UPS—famous for its ORION routing agent—point out that drivers’ feedback loops and training on AI systems were major contributors to AI success and a $300 million annual cost savings. Well-informed employees can provide critical input and engage in feedback loops essential for refining AI models. Employees who understand AI are more capable of contributing effectively, which helps reduce job displacement concerns and fosters a culture of growth and adaptability. Enhancing AI literacy across the organization is key to unlocking the full potential of agentic AI and ensuring successful integration.

Pitfall 4: Failing to Engage Impacted Users or Change Champions
The human role in AI adoption cannot be overstated. Early and continuous employee involvement from pilot phases to full-scale implementation is crucial for mitigating both practical and psychological barriers. Recent data shows that 70% of AI adoption failures trace back to process or people issues rather than technical shortcomings. Engaging change champions throughout the development and deployment of agentic AI allows employees to identify and address potential risks, enhancing their confidence and understanding of AI's benefits.

Effective change management bridges the gap between AI capabilities and employee collaboration, ensuring a cohesive and engaged workforce. Experimenting with autonomous agents and offering feedback on outcomes further reduces perceived risks and builds confidence in using AI in daily work. Addressing employee concerns, incorporating their feedback for model training, and celebrating early successes are critical to rallying support for agentic AI initiatives. Some firms provide AI “co-pilot” modes before going fully autonomous, enabling staff to observe and learn from AI behavior. This approach to achieving optimal automation and orchestration maturity creates a supportive environment for a smoother and more efficient transition.


Pitfall 5: Overlooking Governance and Responsible AI
Failing to address security and privacy concerns can significantly impede the adoption of agentic AI, as both leaders and employees may be reluctant to trust autonomous outcomes without assurances of data protection and ethical practices. Therefore, AI literacy and change champion efforts must focus on AI model security measures and transparently address ethical practices in AI development and maintenance. A late-2024 study found 53% of tech leaders cite security as the top challenge in deploying AI agents, underscoring the importance of robust governance.

Transparent AI policies and robust governance frameworks that clearly outline how data is managed, monitored, and secured can enhance acceptance and build trust in agentic AI systems. Many enterprises are now setting up AI governance committees and requiring a human-in-the-loop approach, especially for early deployments. The influence of ethics and trust on AI adoption highlights the need to prioritize ethical usage and trust-building initiatives. By proactively addressing these concerns, organizations can foster a culture of trust and acceptance among their workforce, which is vital for successful integration.

Companies should develop clear guidelines aligned with intended agentic AI maturity levels of governance and people, maintaining data transparency and privacy, implementing security protocols, and continuously monitoring AI systems. In an environment where security and ethical considerations are paramount, organizations can mitigate fears and build confidence, facilitating smoother adoption of agentic AI technologies.
