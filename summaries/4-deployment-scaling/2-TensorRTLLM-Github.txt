TensorRT LLM Overview
TensorRT LLM is an open-sourced library for optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference. It provides state-of-the-art optimizations, including custom attention kernels, inflight batching, paged KV caching, quantization (FP8, FP4, INT4 AWQ, INT8 SmoothQuant, ...), speculative decoding, and much more, to perform inference efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs.

Architected on PyTorch, TensorRT LLM provides a high-level Python LLM API that supports a wide range of inference setups - from single-GPU to multi-GPU or multi-node deployments. It includes built-in support for various parallelism strategies and advanced features. The LLM API integrates seamlessly with the broader inference ecosystem, including NVIDIA Dynamo and the Triton Inference Server.

TensorRT LLM is designed to be modular and easy to modify. Its PyTorch-native architecture allows developers to experiment with the runtime or extend functionality. Several popular models are also pre-defined and can be customized using native PyTorch code, making it easy to adapt the system to specific needs.

Release Notes
Deprecation Policy
Deprecation is used to inform developers that some APIs and tools are no longer recommended for use. Beginning with version 1.0, TensorRT LLM has the following deprecation policy:

Communication of Deprecation
Deprecation notices are documented in the Release Notes.
Deprecated APIs, methods, classes, or parameters include a statement in the source code indicating when they were deprecated.
If used, deprecated methods, classes, or parameters issue runtime deprecation warnings.
Migration Period
TensorRT LLM provides a 3-month migration period after deprecation.
During this period, deprecated APIs, tools, or parameters continue to work but trigger warnings.
Scope of Deprecation
Full API/Method/Class Deprecation: The entire API/method/class is marked for removal.
Partial Deprecation: If only specific parameters of an API/method are deprecated (e.g., param1 in LLM.generate(param1, param2)), the method itself remains functional, but the deprecated parameters will be removed in a future release.
Removal After Migration Period
After the 3-month migration period ends, deprecated APIs, tools, or parameters are removed in a manner consistent with semantic versioning (major version changes may include breaking removals).
