# Review File Format Template

This template shows the format for creating professional, intuitive review files for each category.

## File Location
Place `review.txt` in each category folder (e.g., `summaries/1-agent-architecture-design/review.txt`)

## Format Structure

### Title (First Line)
```
Category Name: Comprehensive Review
```

### Main Sections
Use ALL CAPS for major section headings:
```
OVERVIEW: SECTION TITLE

Paragraph explaining the concept in detail. Use full sentences and narrative flow. Explain why it matters, how it works, and what the implications are. Each paragraph should be a complete thought that builds understanding.

Another paragraph continuing the explanation. Connect ideas logically. Use transitions between concepts. Make it readable and engaging, not just a list of facts.

MAJOR CONCEPT: DESCRIPTIVE SUBTITLE

More detailed explanation of the concept. Break down complex ideas into digestible paragraphs. Use examples where helpful. Explain relationships between concepts.
```

### Key Terms Section
At the end, include a KEY TERMS section with definitions:

```
KEY TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

Term Name: Clear, concise definition that explains what the term means and why it matters in the context of this category.

Another Term: Another definition that helps readers understand the concept. Keep definitions focused and practical.

Important Concept: Definition that ties together multiple ideas and shows how they relate to the broader domain.
```

## Formatting Rules

1. **Headings**: Use ALL CAPS for main sections (e.g., "OVERVIEW: WHAT IS X?")
2. **Subheadings**: Use descriptive text with colons (e.g., "CONCEPT NAME: DESCRIPTIVE SUBTITLE")
3. **Paragraphs**: Each line should be a complete paragraph, not bullet points
4. **Key Terms**: Format as "Term: Definition" or "Term - Definition"
5. **No Markdown**: Use plain text only - no markdown syntax
6. **Narrative Flow**: Write in paragraph form, not lists or outlines
