Introduction
NVIDIA NeMo Framework is a scalable and cloud-native generative AI framework built for researchers and PyTorch developers working on Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Models (MMs), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text to Speech (TTS), and Computer Vision (CV) domains. It is designed to help you efficiently create, customize, and deploy new generative AI models by leveraging existing code and pre-trained model checkpoints.

For technical documentation, please see the NeMo Framework User Guide.

What's New in NeMo 2.0
NVIDIA NeMo 2.0 introduces several significant improvements over its predecessor, NeMo 1.0, enhancing flexibility, performance, and scalability.

Python-Based Configuration - NeMo 2.0 transitions from YAML files to a Python-based configuration, providing more flexibility and control. This shift makes it easier to extend and customize configurations programmatically.

Modular Abstractions - By adopting PyTorch Lightning’s modular abstractions, NeMo 2.0 simplifies adaptation and experimentation. This modular approach allows developers to more easily modify and experiment with different components of their models.

Scalability - NeMo 2.0 seamlessly scaling large-scale experiments across thousands of GPUs using NeMo-Run, a powerful tool designed to streamline the configuration, execution, and management of machine learning experiments across computing environments.

Overall, these enhancements make NeMo 2.0 a powerful, scalable, and user-friendly framework for AI model development.

Important

NeMo 2.0 is currently supported by the LLM (large language model) and VLM (vision language model) collections.

Get Started with NeMo 2.0
Refer to the Quickstart for examples of using NeMo-Run to launch NeMo 2.0 experiments locally and on a slurm cluster.
For more information about NeMo 2.0, see the NeMo Framework User Guide.
NeMo 2.0 Recipes contains additional examples of launching large-scale runs using NeMo 2.0 and NeMo-Run.
For an in-depth exploration of the main features of NeMo 2.0, see the Feature Guide.
To transition from NeMo 1.0 to 2.0, see the Migration Guide for step-by-step instructions.
Get Started with Cosmos
NeMo Curator and NeMo Framework support video curation and post-training of the Cosmos World Foundation Models, which are open and available on NGC and Hugging Face. For more information on video datasets, refer to NeMo Curator. To post-train World Foundation Models using the NeMo Framework for your custom physical AI tasks, see the Cosmos Diffusion models and the Cosmos Autoregressive models.

LLMs and MMs Training, Alignment, and Customization
All NeMo models are trained with Lightning. Training is automatically scalable to 1000s of GPUs. You can check the performance benchmarks using the latest NeMo Framework container here.

When applicable, NeMo models leverage cutting-edge distributed training techniques, incorporating parallelism strategies to enable efficient training of very large models. These techniques include Tensor Parallelism (TP), Pipeline Parallelism (PP), Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and Mixed Precision Training with BFloat16 and FP8, as well as others.

NeMo Transformer-based LLMs and MMs utilize NVIDIA Transformer Engine for FP8 training on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while leveraging NVIDIA Megatron Core for scaling Transformer model training.

NeMo LLMs can be aligned with state-of-the-art methods such as SteerLM, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). See NVIDIA NeMo Aligner for more information.

In addition to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), NeMo also supports the latest parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA, P-Tuning, Adapters, and IA3. Refer to the NeMo Framework User Guide for the full list of supported models and techniques.

LLMs and MMs Deployment and Optimization
NeMo LLMs and MMs can be deployed and optimized with NVIDIA NeMo Microservices.

Speech AI
NeMo ASR and TTS models can be optimized for inference and deployed for production use cases with NVIDIA Riva.

NeMo Framework Launcher
Important

NeMo Framework Launcher is compatible with NeMo version 1.0 only. NeMo-Run is recommended for launching experiments using NeMo 2.0.

NeMo Framework Launcher is a cloud-native tool that streamlines the NeMo Framework experience. It is used for launching end-to-end NeMo Framework training jobs on CSPs and Slurm clusters.

The NeMo Framework Launcher includes extensive recipes, scripts, utilities, and documentation for training NeMo LLMs. It also includes the NeMo Framework Autoconfigurator, which is designed to find the optimal model parallel configuration for training on a specific cluster.

To get started quickly with the NeMo Framework Launcher, please see the NeMo Framework Playbooks. The NeMo Framework Launcher does not currently support ASR and TTS training, but it will soon.

Get Started with NeMo Framework
Getting started with NeMo Framework is easy. State-of-the-art pretrained NeMo models are freely available on Hugging Face Hub and NVIDIA NGC. These models can be used to generate text or images, transcribe audio, and synthesize speech in just a few lines of code.

We have extensive tutorials that can be run on Google Colab or with our NGC NeMo Framework Container. We also have playbooks for users who want to train NeMo models with the NeMo Framework Launcher.

For advanced users who want to train NeMo models from scratch or fine-tune existing NeMo models, we have a full suite of example scripts that support multi-GPU/multi-node training.
