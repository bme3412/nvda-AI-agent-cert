Overview

What Is NVIDIA NeMo?

NVIDIA NeMo™ is a modular software suite for managing the AI agent lifecycle. It provides microservices and toolkits for data processing, model fine-tuning and evaluation, reinforcement learning, policy enforcement, and system observability. NeMo helps enterprises build, monitor, and optimize agentic AI systems at scale, on any GPU-accelerated infrastructure. It integrates with existing AI platforms and supports cloud, on-premises, and hybrid deployment, enabling enterprises to rapidly manage and effortlessly create data flywheels that continuously optimize AI agents. A new NVIDIA AI Blueprint for Building Data Flywheels is now available, enabling developers to build an automated data flywheel that continuously powers generative and agentic AI applications with more accurate and efficient models.

Benefits

NVIDIA NeMo offers several key benefits for enterprises developing agentic AI systems. The platform provides modular AI agent lifecycle management, enabling organizations to manage the complete lifecycle—from data curation, customization, and evaluation to guardrailing, observability, and optimization—with an enterprise-ready, interoperable software suite. This comprehensive approach supports seamless deployment and scaling, allowing teams to easily build data flywheels that use enterprise data to improve AI agents, powering the entire flywheel with simple Helm chart deployments or API calls for various parts of the workflow.

The platform delivers increased ROI by enabling organizations to quickly train, customize, and deploy large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), video AI, and speech AI at scale, reducing time to solution and increasing return on investment. Accelerated performance is achieved through GPU-accelerated optimization, multi-node scaling, and tuning for cost-efficient training, deployment, and continuous improvement, maximizing AI agent performance and throughput. NeMo also supports safer agentic AI by providing capabilities to vet models, guardrail prompts, and continuously scan for vulnerabilities. The platform is production ready, offering a secure, optimized, full-stack solution with support, security, and API stability as part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, enabling organizations to build, monitor, and optimize AI agents anywhere—from the cloud and data center to the edge.

Features

The AI agent lifecycle is an end-to-end process for developing and improving AI agents in production applications. NVIDIA NeMo provides tools that enable each step of this workflow, so enterprises can build powerful, secure, and continuously learning agents. The platform's features are organized around three primary phases: Build, Deploy, and Optimize.

The Build phase encompasses data preparation, model selection, and agent development. NeMo Curator enables teams to clean, filter, and prepare multimodal data, processing existing multimodal datasets into high-quality, AI-ready formats for development pipelines, while NeMo Data Designer allows organizations to create domain-specific datasets from scratch and generate synthetic data to close critical data gaps. For model selection, NVIDIA Nemotron provides state-of-the-art open multimodal reasoning models, enabling teams to pick or build models suited to their use case. NeMo Retriever offers extraction, embedding, and reranking models for RAG pipelines, while NeMo Evaluator supports benchmarking, testing, and evaluating models and agents, validating with academic benchmarks and running custom evaluations. The NeMo Agent Toolkit serves as a framework-agnostic toolkit to build, profile, and optimize AI agents, turning custom models into scalable applications, seamlessly connecting them to enterprise stacks and tools, and defining workflows with flexible orchestration.

The Deploy phase focuses on production deployment with maximum performance and safety. NVIDIA NIM enables organizations to run AI models in optimized containers, exposed as OpenAI-compatible APIs, optimizing agents for production with high-throughput, low-latency inference to ensure they can scale to meet enterprise demands and deliver fast, reliable responses. NeMo Retriever supports building accurate, privacy-preserving RAG pipelines, using retrieval-augmented generation to anchor agent responses in trusted knowledge. NeMo Guardrails enforces safety, compliance, and control across AI interactions, applying safety, compliance, and content moderation guardrails to ensure secure agent behavior.

The Optimize phase enables continuous improvement through monitoring, feedback collection, and data flywheel implementation. The NeMo Agent Toolkit provides framework-agnostic capabilities to build, profile, and optimize AI agents, tracking real-world interactions with users and other systems and systematically evaluating performance and accuracy to find opportunities for continuous improvement. NeMo Customizer enables fine-tuning and aligning models with domain data, while NeMo Framework provides an open-source toolkit for training and aligning LLMs and multimodal models. For continuous improvement with data flywheels, NeMo RL post-trains and aligns models at scale with advanced reinforcement learning techniques, while NeMo Gym provides simulated training environments to generate high-quality agentic RL rollouts. NeMo Evaluator benchmarks, tests, and evaluates models and agents, using the feedback and data gathered from monitoring to create a data-driven flywheel that iteratively retrains the agent to continuously optimize and stay effective over time.

Use Cases

NVIDIA NeMo supports various industry use cases and jump-starts AI development across multiple domains. AI agents are transforming customer service across sectors, helping companies enhance customer conversations, achieve high resolution rates, and improve human representative productivity. AI agents can handle predictive tasks, reason and problem-solve, be trained to understand industry-specific terms, and pull relevant information from an organization's knowledge bases, wherever that data resides. These capabilities make NeMo suitable for applications including AI assistants, information retrieval systems, content generation tools, and humanoid robot control systems.

Customer Adoption

Industry leaders are driving innovation with NeMo across various sectors. Worley has deployed NVIDIA NIM microservices to transform their EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) business with agentic AI, leveraging NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA NIM, NVIDIA NeMo Framework, and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. Shell has trained a custom AI chatbot with NVIDIA NeMo to uplevel operations, utilizing NVIDIA NeMo, NVIDIA NeMo Curator, and NVIDIA NeMo Framework. Amdocs has built generative AI agents for telecommunications, using NVIDIA DGX Cloud, NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Nemotron, and the NVIDIA NeMo framework. Leading adopters span industries including AI research organizations, cloud providers, telecommunications companies, technology platforms, and energy companies, demonstrating the broad applicability of NeMo across diverse enterprise use cases.

Starting Options

Organizations can get started with NVIDIA NeMo through several pathways. The first option involves trying NVIDIA-optimized foundation models like NVIDIA Nemotron to evaluate capabilities before committing to full platform deployment. The second option enables teams to build, monitor, and optimize AI agents with the complete NVIDIA NeMo platform, providing access to the full suite of lifecycle management tools. The third option involves jump-starting AI solution development with NVIDIA Blueprints, which provide pre-configured workflows and templates for common use cases, accelerating time to deployment and reducing implementation complexity.
