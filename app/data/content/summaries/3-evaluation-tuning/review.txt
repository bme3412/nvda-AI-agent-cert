Evaluation and Tuning: Comprehensive Review

OVERVIEW: UNDERSTANDING AND IMPROVING AGENTIC AI SYSTEMS

Evaluation and tuning represent the critical disciplines of understanding, measuring, and improving agentic AI systems as they transition from experimental prototypes to production deployments. Unlike traditional software where behavior is deterministic and predictable, agentic AI systems introduce complexity through autonomous decision-making, non-deterministic outputs, and continuous adaptation. This domain focuses on transforming agents from "black boxes" with opaque reasoning into "glass boxes" that provide transparency, enabling trust, optimization, and reliable operation at scale.

The fundamental challenge lies in the autonomous nature of agentic systems. Traditional AI operates on simple input-output patterns where you can test specific inputs and verify outputs. Agentic AI systems, however, make autonomous decisions about how to achieve goals, which tools to use, and what information to gather. This autonomy introduces variability that requires sophisticated evaluation approaches combining offline testing with online monitoring, quantitative metrics with qualitative assessment, and automated evaluation with human judgment.

Observability forms the foundation of effective evaluation and tuning. Without visibility into agent behavior, diagnosing issues, optimizing performance, and ensuring reliability becomes nearly impossible. Observability tools capture traces representing complete agent tasks and spans representing individual steps, creating hierarchical structures that reveal exactly what happened at each stage of execution. This visibility enables teams to identify bottlenecks, understand decision-making processes, and build trust through transparency.

AGENT INTELLIGENCE TOOLKIT: FRAMEWORK-AGNOSTIC OBSERVABILITY

The NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit (formerly Agent Intelligence Toolkit or AIQ) represents a paradigm shift in agent development tooling, providing framework-agnostic observability and evaluation that works alongside any agent framework without requiring rebuilds or framework lock-in. Whether you're using LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, Microsoft Semantic Kernel, Google ADK, Strands Agents, custom enterprise frameworks, or simple Python agents, the toolkit complements existing technology stacks without forcing replatforming. The toolkit also supports deploying agents securely on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore runtime, expanding deployment options for enterprise environments.

The toolkit's core philosophy emphasizes reusability and composability, with every agent, tool, and workflow existing as a function call that works together in complex software applications. This design enables developers to build components once and reuse them across different scenarios, significantly accelerating development. You can start with pre-built agents, tools, or workflows and customize them to specific needs, allowing teams to move quickly if they're already working with agents.

Profiling capabilities instrument entire workflows down to the tool and agent level, monitoring input/output tokens, timings, and identifying bottlenecks. The toolkit encourages wrapping every tool and agent for maximum profiler benefit, but provides complete freedom to integrate at whatever level makes sense—starting small and expanding as you see value. This flexibility allows teams to focus on areas where they expect the most benefit initially, then expand integration gradually.

Observability features include dedicated integrations with popular platforms like Phoenix, Weave, and Langfuse, plus compatibility with OpenTelemetry-based platforms. This enables comprehensive monitoring, debugging, and insights into agent behaviors across the entire execution graph. The system creates distributed tracing across nested function calls with preserved parent-child relationships, enabling developers to understand complex workflows as they execute.

Evaluation capabilities provide structured validation using frameworks like RAGAS for RAG workflows, assessing answer accuracy, context relevance, and response groundedness through judge LLMs. The toolkit includes a built-in evaluation system to validate and maintain accuracy of agentic workflows, going beyond simple pass-fail metrics to provide nuanced quality assessments that guide iterative improvement.

Recent enhancements include automatic hyperparameter tuning that optimizes parameters and prompts of agents, tools, and workflows to maximize performance, minimize costs, and increase accuracy. Function Groups allow packaging multiple related functions together to share configuration, context, and resources. Full Model Context Protocol (MCP) support enables using the toolkit as either an MCP client to connect to remote MCP servers or as an MCP server to publish your own tools via MCP.

The toolkit includes a built-in user interface that provides a chat interface for interacting with agents and debugging workflows. The UI allows interaction with running workflows through both HTTP API and WebSocket connections, providing features like chat history and controls for enabling or disabling intermediate steps. You can expand all intermediate steps by default or override steps that share the same ID, giving flexibility in how you view and manage workflow execution. The interface supports real-time streaming of intermediate results through endpoints like chat/stream, allowing you to see workflow progress as it executes. Configuration options include theme selection, endpoint configuration for chat completion, WebSocket URL settings, and workflow schema type definitions for WebSocket connections.

Getting started with the toolkit requires Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13, with installation available through PyPI. The toolkit offers optional dependencies grouped by framework that can be installed alongside the core package—for example, you can install LangChain/LangGraph plugins separately or install all optional dependencies at once. The toolkit provides a simple "Hello World" example that can be run in Google Colab with no setup required, demonstrating how to create a workflow configuration file that defines agents, tools, and workflows using YAML format. This example showcases the toolkit's capabilities by creating a ReAct agent (an agent that reasons and acts) with access to a Wikipedia search tool and an NVIDIA NIM language model, demonstrating the core workflow pattern of defining functions and tools, specifying which LLM to use, and configuring agent behavior with options like verbosity and retry limits.

The user interface lives in a git submodule and requires Node.js version 18 or higher. Starting the toolkit server uses a simple command with a configuration file that defines your workflow, initializing callback handlers, filling prompt variables, and building the agent graph. The server runs on localhost port 8000 by default, ready to accept requests through HTTP endpoints like generate, generate/stream, chat, and chat/stream. The web interface runs on port 3000, providing an accessible way to interact with and debug agent workflows. NVIDIA provides extensive additional resources including comprehensive documentation, getting started guides, contribution guidelines, numerous examples in the source repository, guides for creating and customizing workflows, evaluation documentation, troubleshooting resources, and a public roadmap showing future development plans.

OBSERVABILITY: FROM BLACK BOXES TO GLASS BOXES

Observability transforms AI agents from opaque systems where internal state and reasoning are invisible into transparent systems that provide the visibility needed for trust, debugging, and optimization. The goal is creating "glass boxes" that offer transparency vital for building trust and ensuring agents operate as intended. Without observability, diagnosing issues or optimizing performance becomes extremely difficult, making it a foundational requirement for production deployment.

Traces and spans form the core data structures of observability. A trace represents a complete agent task from start to finish, like handling a user query or executing a multi-step workflow. Spans are the individual steps within that trace, such as calling a language model, retrieving data from a vector database, or invoking a tool. This hierarchical structure allows teams to understand exactly what happened at each stage of an agent's execution, providing the granularity needed to diagnose problems and optimize performance.

Observability becomes critical when transitioning AI agents to production environments. For debugging and root-cause analysis, observability tools provide the traces needed to pinpoint error sources, which is especially important in complex agents involving multiple LLM calls, tool interactions, and conditional logic. For latency and cost management, observability enables precise tracking of API calls that are billed per token or per call, helping identify operations that are excessively slow or expensive so teams can optimize prompts, select more efficient models, or redesign workflows.

For trust, safety, and compliance, observability provides an audit trail of agent actions and decisions that can detect and mitigate issues like prompt injection, generation of harmful content, or mishandling of personally identifiable information. Perhaps most importantly, observability data forms the foundation of continuous improvement loops, where production insights inform offline experimentation and refinement, creating a feedback cycle that leads to progressively better agent performance.

Key metrics for monitoring agent behavior include latency (how quickly the agent responds), costs (expense per agent run), request errors (failed requests including API errors or failed tool calls), user feedback (both explicit ratings and implicit behaviors like query rephrasing), accuracy (frequency of correct or desirable outputs), and automated evaluation metrics using LLMs to score outputs for helpfulness and accuracy.

OpenTelemetry has emerged as an industry standard for LLM observability, providing APIs, SDKs, and tools for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data. Many instrumentation libraries wrap existing agent frameworks, making it easy to export spans to observability tools with minimal code. Developers can also manually create spans and enrich them with custom attributes like user IDs, session IDs, or model versions, including business-specific data, intermediate computations, or any context useful for debugging or analysis.

EVALUATION: MEASURING AND IMPROVING AGENT PERFORMANCE

Agent evaluation is the process of analyzing observability data and performing tests to determine how well an AI agent is performing and how it can be improved. Regular evaluation is important because AI agents are often non-deterministic and can evolve through updates or drifting model behavior—without evaluation, you wouldn't know if your agent is actually doing its job well or if it has regressed. There are two complementary categories: offline evaluation and online evaluation.

Offline evaluation involves evaluating the agent in a controlled setting using test datasets rather than live user queries. Teams use curated datasets where expected outputs or correct behaviors are known, then run agents on those datasets to measure performance. For instance, a math word-problem agent might be tested against 100 problems with known answers. This approach is often done during development and can be part of CI/CD pipelines to check improvements or guard against regressions. The benefit is repeatability and clear accuracy metrics since ground truth is available.

The key challenge with offline evaluation is ensuring test datasets remain comprehensive and relevant—agents might perform well on fixed test sets but encounter very different queries in production. Therefore, test sets should be updated with new edge cases and examples reflecting real-world scenarios, using a mix of small "smoke test" cases for quick checks and larger evaluation sets for broader performance metrics.

Online evaluation refers to evaluating the agent in live, real-world environments during actual usage in production. This involves monitoring agent performance on real user interactions and analyzing outcomes continuously, tracking metrics like success rates and user satisfaction scores on live traffic. The advantage is capturing things you might not anticipate in controlled settings—observing model drift over time as input patterns shift and catching unexpected queries or situations not present in test data.

Online evaluation often involves collecting implicit and explicit user feedback and possibly running shadow tests or A/B tests where new agent versions run in parallel for comparison. The challenge is that getting reliable labels or scores for live interactions can be tricky, often relying on user feedback or downstream metrics like whether users clicked results or completed desired actions.

These two evaluation approaches are highly complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Insights from online monitoring—such as new types of user queries where agents perform poorly—can augment and improve offline test datasets. Conversely, agents performing well in offline tests can be more confidently deployed and monitored online. Many teams adopt a continuous loop: evaluate offline, deploy, monitor online, collect new failure cases, add to offline dataset, refine agent, and repeat. This iterative process ensures agents continuously improve based on real-world performance.

Evaluation should occur at every step of the agent workflow. This includes evaluating the initial request to language models or servers for proper connection, response times, and model selection; the agent's ability to identify user intent to ensure task completion capability; the agent's ability to identify the right tools for performing tasks; the tools' responses to agent requests, watching for errors, malformed responses, or uptime issues; and collecting feedback on agent responses through UI mechanisms like thumbs up/down, user satisfaction ratings, manual evaluation, and LLM-based response judging.

AGENTIC AI: EVOLUTION BEYOND GENERATIVE AI

Agentic AI represents the next evolution beyond generative AI, moving from simple one-step prompt-and-response interactions to complex multi-step processes where AI systems interact with different platforms to achieve desired outcomes. Unlike traditional generative AI where you prompt a model and receive an answer, agentic AI engages in sophisticated workflows—for example, an AI-powered help desk could autonomously understand IT support tickets, reset passwords, install software updates, and escalate issues to human staff when necessary.

Agentic AI represents the third wave of AI development. The first wave introduced technologies like recommendation engines and auto-fill text that analyzed large datasets to identify patterns and calculate likely outcomes. The second wave brought generative AI, which enabled systems to create content including text, images, and music. This third wave focuses on bringing disparate elements and abilities together under the umbrella of choice and autonomous decision-making.

The key difference between agentic AI and traditional AI lies in autonomy and goal-orientation. Traditional AI systems are rule- and logic-based, taking in data, processing it, and producing output for predefined tasks. Agentic AI, by contrast, has the independence to seek out additional information and context to make better decisions. This ability to autonomously gather relevant context and make nuanced decisions is what sets agentic AI apart.

The operational workflow of agentic AI systems follows a structured process that begins with establishing a goal and parameters from human input. An appropriate large language model then processes this information to chain together the tasks needed to achieve the goal while remaining within established constraints. The system then makes autonomous decisions about how to achieve its objectives, executing with or without human interaction as appropriate. Throughout this process, the agent takes in data from parallel tasks and adjusts workflows as needed—cutting steps for optimization or adding new ones for further data gathering.

What makes these systems particularly compelling is their ability to adapt based on real-time data and apply recorded results into a systematic feedback loop, commonly known as the "data flywheel," which improves accuracy and efficiency over time. This continuous learning capability enables agents to become more effective through operational experience, unlike static systems that require manual updates.

CHALLENGES IN AGENTIC AI ADOPTION

Agentic AI presents several significant challenges that organizations must address to ensure trustworthiness and security. The first major challenge is model logic and critical thinking. In agentic AI systems, one agent acts as a "planner" that orchestrates multiple other agents, while a separate model provides a "critical thinker" function that offers feedback on the planner's output and the actions of executing agents. The more feedback generated, the better the insights and outputs become. However, for this to work effectively, the critical thinker model needs training on data that's closely grounded in reality, with extensive information on specific goals, plans, actions, and results. This requires many iterations—potentially hundreds or thousands of plan-and-result cycles—before the model has sufficient data to function as an effective critical thinker, making the development process resource-intensive and time-consuming.

Reliability and predictability present the second challenge. Traditional software development is inherently predictable—engineers write code that tells computers exactly what to do, step by step. Agentic AI fundamentally changes this paradigm because you don't tell the agent what to do step by step; instead, you specify the desired outcome and the agent determines how to reach that goal. This autonomy introduces randomness in outputs, similar to what we saw when ChatGPT and other generative AI systems first debuted. However, just as generative AI has seen considerable improvements in consistency over the past two years through fine-tuning, human feedback loops, and continuous training efforts, agentic AI will require similar dedicated effort to minimize randomness and become more predictable and reliable.

Data privacy and security represent perhaps the most concerning challenge, as these issues are similar to those in generative AI but amplified by agentic AI's broader access and autonomy. When users engage with language models, every piece of information becomes embedded in the model with no way to make it "forget" that data, creating vulnerabilities to attacks like prompt injection that attempt to leak proprietary information. Because software agents have access to many different systems with high levels of autonomy, the risk of exposing private data from multiple sources increases significantly. To address this, companies need to start small and containerize data as much as possible to prevent exposure beyond the internal domain where it's needed. Critical steps include anonymizing data by obscuring users and stripping personally identifiable information like social security numbers or addresses from prompts before sending them to models.

Data quality and relevancy constitute the fourth challenge. Once data and users have been anonymized, agentic models must deliver results grounded in quality data relevant to user prompts—a significant hurdle. Generative AI models already struggle to deliver expected results when disconnected from accurate, current data, and agentic AI systems face additional complexity because they need to access data across a wide variety of platforms and sources. Data streaming platforms can help by providing tools that enable relevant answers using high-quality data. Agentic AI systems will only overcome hallucinations and generate correct responses if they're grounded in reliable, fresh data.

NAVIGATING ADOPTION PITFALLS

Organizations face five common pitfalls when adopting agentic AI that can significantly impede success. The first critical pitfall is taking a technology-only approach. It's tempting for companies adopting agentic AI to focus solely on technology while ignoring the broader organizational context, but successful AI transformation requires a holistic approach encompassing strategy, capabilities, ethical standards, and workforce development. A 2024 survey revealed that 86% of organizations need to upgrade their existing technology stack and reevaluate their structures and processes to deploy AI agents effectively, indicating that treating agentic AI as a plug-and-play solution often leads to breakdowns.

The second pitfall involves not aligning and setting leadership expectations. Strong leadership and clear communication are paramount in tackling AI mistrust and breaking down silos, with leaders playing a critical role in championing AI initiatives and fostering inclusive environments that bolster trust. However, when leaders lack clarity on expected outcomes of agentic AI, it becomes challenging to align implementation with organizational goals and unlock its full value. Recent data shows that more than 90% of IT executives have implemented at least one AI instance, yet nearly half aren't sure how to demonstrate the value. Transformation failures can often be traced back to lack of strong sponsorship and unclear or unrealistic expectations of success.

The third pitfall is not closing AI literacy gaps. AI literacy is essential for successful adoption, as employees with higher AI literacy are less likely to harbor misconceptions and more likely to accept and trust AI. Conversely, low AI literacy among leaders and employees can significantly hinder adoption, limiting AI's transformative potential within organizations. When leaders lack understanding of AI's capabilities, limitations, and needed governance, they're ill-equipped to champion AI initiatives and set realistic expectations. To avoid unrealistic goal-setting and inefficient implementation, leaders must be upskilled in AI literacy, ideally within the context of specific use cases.

The fourth pitfall is failing to engage impacted users or change champions. The human role in AI adoption cannot be overstated, with early and continuous employee involvement from pilot phases to full-scale implementation crucial for mitigating both practical and psychological barriers. Recent data shows that 70% of AI adoption failures trace back to process or people issues rather than technical shortcomings. Engaging change champions throughout the development and deployment of agentic AI allows employees to identify and address potential risks, enhancing their confidence and understanding of AI's benefits.

The fifth and final pitfall is overlooking governance and responsible AI. Failing to address security and privacy concerns can significantly impede agentic AI adoption, as both leaders and employees may be reluctant to trust autonomous outcomes without assurances of data protection and ethical practices. A late-2024 study found 53% of tech leaders cite security as the top challenge in deploying AI agents, underscoring the importance of robust governance. Transparent AI policies and robust governance frameworks that clearly outline how data is managed, monitored, and secured can enhance acceptance and build trust in agentic AI systems.

COST OPTIMIZATION AND PERFORMANCE TUNING

Managing costs when deploying AI agents to production requires strategic approaches. Using smaller models—Small Language Models (SLMs)—can perform well on certain agentic use cases while significantly reducing costs, with evaluation systems helping determine performance versus larger models. Teams should consider using SLMs for simpler tasks like intent classification or parameter extraction while reserving larger models for complex reasoning.

Using router models represents a similar strategy, employing diverse models and sizes with an LLM/SLM or serverless function to route requests based on complexity to best-fit models, reducing costs while ensuring performance on appropriate tasks. Caching responses for common requests and tasks before they go through the agentic system reduces the volume of similar requests, with flows to identify similarity to cached requests using basic AI models. This strategy can significantly reduce costs for frequently asked questions or common workflows.

Common issues when deploying AI agents to production include agents not performing tasks consistently, which can be addressed by refining prompts to be clear on objectives or dividing tasks into subtasks handled by multiple agents. Agents running into continuous loops can be fixed by ensuring clear termination conditions and using larger models specialized for reasoning tasks. When agent tool calls aren't performing well, teams should test and validate tool outputs outside the agent system and refine defined parameters, prompts, and tool naming.

Multi-agent systems not performing consistently can benefit from refining prompts for each agent to ensure they're specific and distinct, or building hierarchical systems using routing or controller agents to determine the correct agent for each task. Many of these issues can be identified more effectively with observability in place, as traces and metrics help pinpoint exactly where in agent workflows problems occur.

BEST PRACTICES: BUILDING TRUST AND RELIABILITY

Getting started with agentic AI requires a systematic approach across key steps. Organizations must first define clear objectives, recognizing that agentic AI's autonomous capabilities require well-specified goals. Architecting for robustness and reliability means setting performance benchmarks, security protocols, and quality reviews while committing to continuous monitoring. Safety layers should include technical guardrails, security measures, and human oversight checkpoints.

Organizations need to limit scope and autonomy through parameters like decision thresholds that trigger human intervention and constraints on certain actions. Focus on explainability ensures that decisions can be understood and improved. Clear controls must address privacy, security, and compliance at every decision point. Continuous monitoring tracks performance, accuracy, and behavior patterns to identify issues early. Finally, encouraging collaboration and multidisciplinary input brings diverse perspectives that reduce blind spots and risks.

The key takeaways for successful agentic AI adoption form a comprehensive framework. Organizations need a holistic mindset that aligns AI projects with organizational structures, leadership readiness, and ethical considerations. Leadership clarity requires providing clear expectations and strong sponsorship, defining realistic use cases and ROI targets. Closing literacy gaps means upskilling both leaders and employees to foster trust, realistic expectations, and collaboration with autonomous agents.

Employee engagement should be early and continuous to reduce resistance and boost adoption, potentially using a "co-pilot" model where AI makes suggestions before scaling autonomy gradually. Finally, responsible governance demands that data protection, security, and transparent ethics frameworks be prioritized, with robust oversight through human-in-the-loop approaches and strong governance committees.

As AI agents increasingly take on decision-making tasks, humans must transition to more strategic, supervisory, and creative roles while broadening their skills in critical thinking, complex problem-solving, and collaboration. These profound changes bring challenges including heightened anxiety over perceived loss of control and ethical concerns around autonomous decision-making. Transparent communication, strategic guidance, increased AI literacy, and updated interaction models can mitigate these anxieties and align autonomous decisions with organizational values.
