Understanding NVIDIA Agent Intelligence (AIQ) Toolkit User Interface
The NVIDIA Agent Intelligence (AIQ) toolkit provides a user interface that allows you to interact with your running workflows in several ways. The interface includes features like chat history, the ability to interact with workflows through both HTTP API and WebSocket connections, and controls for enabling or disabling intermediate steps in your workflow. You can also expand all intermediate steps by default or override steps that share the same ID, giving you flexibility in how you view and manage your workflow execution.
Before you can use the user interface, you need to ensure your environment is properly set up. The AIQ toolkit UI lives in a git submodule, so you'll need to check out all git submodules to access it. This is done with a simple git command that initializes and updates all submodules recursively. Additionally, you'll need Node.js version 18 or higher installed on your system to run the web interface.
Starting the AIQ toolkit server is straightforward using the aiq serve command along with a configuration file that defines your workflow. When you run this command, the server will initialize and start up, producing log output that shows various stages of initialization including registering callback handlers, filling prompt variables, and building the agent graph. Once fully initialized, the server runs on localhost port 8000 by default and is ready to accept requests.
After the server is running, you can verify it's working properly by making HTTP requests to interact with your workflow. This involves sending POST requests to specific endpoints like the generate endpoint, including your input message and any configuration options. The server will process your request and return a response based on your workflow's logic and the current state of any relevant data.
Launching the actual user interface requires navigating to the UI directory, installing the necessary Node.js dependencies, and starting the development server. Once the development server is running, you can access the web interface through your browser at localhost port 3000, with port 3001 available as an alternative if the default port is already in use.
To connect the user interface to your running AIQ toolkit server, you need to configure the settings through the settings icon located in the bottom left corner of the interface. The configuration options include choosing between light or dark themes, specifying the HTTP URL for chat completion (with several endpoint options like generate, generate/stream, chat, and chat/stream), setting the WebSocket URL for real-time connections, and defining the workflow schema type for WebSocket connections. NVIDIA recommends using the chat/stream endpoint for the best experience with intermediate results streaming, allowing you to see your workflow's progress in real-time as it executes.
